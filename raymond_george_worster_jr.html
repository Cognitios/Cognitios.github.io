		<center><h3>Raymond "Ray" George Worster Jr</h3>
		<p>1932 - 2015</p>
		<hr>
		<p>Raymond "Ray" George Worster Jr was born on June 12th in St. Johnsbury, Vermont to two Ministers, Raymond George Worster Sr and 
		Lucille Margaret Minton [1]. By 1935 he had moved with his parents to Waterbury, Vermont where he would start school and 
		his younger sister would be born [2].</p>

		<h6>Raymond's Birth Certificate [1]</h6>
		<p>In 1940 his family would move to Foxborough, Massachusetts. In Foxborough his parents were the co-pastors of Bethany Congregational Church. 
		For ten happy years they lived in Foxborough where Ray would attend Foxborough High School. During this time Ray, his sister, and his friends would play
		commandos, ride bikes, build snow forts and have grand snowbll fights. The family had a large barn without any fences, the entire town was their
		playground. Christmas was a special time of year for the Worsters, there were many church events and activities and Ray's paternal grandparents would
		come down from Bangor. There was always a special unwrapped gift under the tree and Ray would wake his sister up at three in the morning to go downstairs
		and see what their treasures [3].</p>
		<p>Foxborough High School started at grade seven and ended at the senior year of high school, Ray would attend all the grades with the exception of his Junior and senior year.
		He would excel in both sports and academics. In grade seven Ray was elected Class President and by his sophomore year he had joined the football team, which he played tackle on for two years.
		In 1948 Ray was accepted to attend Deerfield Academy, an exclusive College Preperatory school where he boarded for two years. At Deerfield he would play
		Junior Varsity Football in his junior year and Varsity in his senior. He would also play League Basketball and Junior League Baseball. He would participate
		in the school play, was a member of the stamp club and was president of the Women Haters Club.
		After Deerfield he would be accepted into Oberlin where he would graduate in 1954 with a Bachelors degree in History.
		In Oberlin he didn't go out for any sports, instead he worked part time at a furniture store.</p>

		<h6>Ray at Deerfield, Nov 1949</h6>
		<p>After he graduated Oberlin he would go onto enlist for four years in the army. He would not often talk of his time in
		the service, he did not enjoy it and a primary reason for him joining was so that he would not get drafted. He was stationed in
		Alaska for a time. During this time he and some buddies would find a baby Pola Bear Cub and played with it for a while, a short while later
		the mother polar bear would find and attack them in defense of her cub. In self defense Ray had to shoot and kill the polar bear,
		the pelt has been kept in the family where it has been restored and is still in the family's possession.</p>

		<h6>The Polar Bear Rug</h6>
		<p>Within the two years of leaving the army he would meet and marry his first wife, Paula Allison Rohles. They would be married 
		on January 9th, 1960, in Alameda, California. In this period of his life, up until 1968 he would work as a foreman to a packaging
		company. He had four of his five daughters during this time. He would also work part time and take classes at a photography shop, owned
		by one of his uncle in law's. Around 1965 he and Paula would move to Chico California and in 1968 he would take residence in Ukiah, Califonia
		where he would live until his death. In 1968 he became an IRS agent, a profession which he worked at until the late 70s where he would start
		his own Tax Returns and Financial Advisement Company.</p>
		<p><b>Ray and Cars</b></p>
		<p><i>"Ray was car crazy from an early age.  He designed them, knew all the makes and models, and could hardly wait to get his license.   
		In fact, he didn’t.  My parents and I attended the graduation at FHS because my father was to give the invocation.  When we left the ceremony, the car was gone!  
		Knowing that something was up, they did not call the police but waited for Ray to come home.  He and his cronies had taken the car to the neighboring town for a joy ride.  
		I had never seen my parents so angry with him.  I felt sorry for him.  His friends tried to take the blame. I can’t remember his punishment but I am sure it was severe."</i> - Ann Martin Worster (Sister of Ray) [3]</p>
		<p><i>"He and I swapped some stories about our military service just before he passed. 
		One thing he always mentioned was the radio he was in charge of operating kept failing when he was out 
		in patrol and sometimes the artillery commanders would radio out to see if people were out on patrol and 
		with his radio not working he couldn't get those messages so they sometimes had to find cover as the 
		artillery guys shot some rounds near where they were patrolling. He never mentioned anybody getting 
		injured because of it though. You can also say that he found his love for car models(and possibly for cars themselves) 
		while in Alaska because he had to find something to do that wasn't just drinking so he started working on car models. 
		They weren't allowed to have them, but he his them on a bookcase behind a bunch of manuals so he wasn't found out. 
		And when he completed one of the models he would mail them home."</i> - Scott Raymond Nunnemaker (Grandson of Ray) [4]</p>

				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>Welcome to Cognitios, this is a continuation of the previous Cognitios by the same author of the original, only revamped. Upon the success of Cognitios, I realized that there needs to be something more than aggregating links in order to educate people; I was just providing a library with some really bad books to learn from and no structure. Google does a better job of that; so instead, I intend to create a curriculum based on a mix of online and offline resources.</p>
				<p>If you have any suggestions for this website, please email me at <ahref="mailto:cognitios@teknik.io"></ahref>cognitios@teknik.io</a>, or you can push a commit if you know how to use git.</p>					
				<p>I plan on making this my own website in the near future depending on the success of this test run. There isn't a point to making my own domain name at this point; all I'm providing is a few frontend guides.</p>					
				<p>Finally, I am not an expert on any of these fields; I consult people who are experts and some anonymous people on the internet. I have aggregated some guides posted by anonymous people and I would like to thank those people here for the work they do not for recognition or self gratification, but because they just want to see the world learn.</p>						
				<h3>News</h3>
				<p>I'm currently just working on putting this up, nothing big to note.</p>

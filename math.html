				<h2>Introduction</h2>
		      <h3>Why Should I learn Math?</h3>
		      </p>I won't lie; if you don't want to learn math, then you shouldn't. Knowing how to use math makes life a lot easier and you can solve problems easier as well. Knowing math takes a bit of practice and public schools have made many people turned off to math because of how they teach it, but learning math correctly will not be the same experience as learning in public schools.</p>
		      <h3>Other Notes</h3>
		      <p>There are other places to get books that I don't recommend; like this <a href="http://gen.lib.rus.ec/">one.</a> However, I mostly get my books through amazon, which while expensive, it is in my opinion important to use a physical book.</p>
		      <p>On getting help: Use <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/">math.StackExchange</a>, <a href="https://www.physicsforums.com/">physicsforum</a>, and maybe <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/math">/r/math</a> or <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmath">/r/learnmath</a> if you need assistance. Remember to be polite; these people aren't getting paid to teach you, they do it out of their love for math and to help others.</p>
		    <h2>The Guide</h2>
		      <h3>Lower Maths</h3>
		      <p> I consider lower maths as something every human being should know before they die.</p>
		      <p>In this guide, lower maths is defined as anything below calculus. Many people are beyond this level and many people are not, so if you feel like you need a better basis of knowledge, then follow this.</p>
		      <p>Honestly, the only thing many people will need is <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy.</a> It is essential that you do the exercises on the website, as practice is essential to understanding with math. Up to the calculus level, Khan Academy is all you will probably need and for higher maths, use Khan Academy as a complimentary resource, but don't solely rely on it. </p>
		      <h3>Calculus</h3>
		      <p>Calculus isn't something everyone should know, but a person's education can't be called fulfilling without grasping the concept of calculus. A person cannot be considered educated unless they know calculus in my opinion. </p>
		      <p>Read <a href="http://amzn.to/1I96gcF">Stewart's book</a>, do one to two chapters three times a week (or daily if you are an overachiever) and on at least one day a week, review what you have learned. Skip the focus on problem-solving until you have finished the entire thing. If you need any assistance, go on <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a> or <a href="http://patrickjmt.com/">PatrickJMT</a> for complimentary resources.</p>
		      <p>Read a Short Intro to Proofs book. I recommend <a href="http://amzn.to/1P1puIU">Velleman's How to Prove It: A Structured Approach</a> and <a href="http://amzn.to/1P1pBV1">Rotman's Journey Into Mathematics: An Introduction to Proofs.</a></p>
		      <p>Get <a href="http://amzn.to/1I96LmU">Spivak's calculus</a> and finish the entire thing.</p>
		      <h3>Higher Maths</h3>
		      <p>Higher maths are everything beyond calculus. Mastering these allows you to call yourself a mathematician, and while not every "educated" person needs to know these; if you wish to reach "Uberman" status, you should.</p>
		      <p>Finish a book on Multivariable and Vector Calculus (I don't have any specific books in mind, please e-mail or commit if you have any ideas). Take <a href="http://amzn.to/1P1pNmZ">Strang's book on Linear Algebra</a> in order to get a good grasp on differential equations from somewhere else. Read either Courant <a href="http://amzn.to/1I97wfX">Vol 1</a> and <a href="http://amzn.to/1P1qhcU">Vol 2</a> or Apostol <a href="http://amzn.to/1I977tK">Vol 1</a> and <a href="http://amzn.to/1P1q1dW">Vol 2.</a> I recommend Apostol in order to get a more rigorous calculus review and also to keep up on your proofs, but it's up to the individual. If you want a challenge, go onto Abstract Algebra (recommend or commit a book). If you want to continue Linear Algebra, read <a href="http://amzn.to/1I97moS">Lay's book</a> before you start on Rudin.</p>
		      <p>Start <a href="http://amzn.to/1P1qs89">Baby Rudin</a>. If you have followed the guide so far and understood everything, then it should be a breeze. If you haven't done Abstract Algebra yet, now is the time.</p>
		      <p>Start <a href="http://amzn.to/1I98fxA">Papa Rudin</a></p>
		    <h2>To-Do</h2>
		      <p>Some subjects and areas need book recommendations. If you have any ideas, either email me at cognitios@teknik.io or commit them.</p>
		      <p>Topology and Algebra all need to be expanded upon a bit more.</p>
		      <p>Geometry, Combinatorics, Set Theory, Logic, and Number Theory all need to be included.</p>

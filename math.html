				<h2>Introduction</h2>
		      <h3>Why Should I learn Math?</h3>
		      </p>I won't lie, if you don't want to learn math then you shouldn't. Knowing how to use math makes life a lot easier and you can solve problems a lot easier. Knowing math takes a bit of practice and public schools have made many people turned off to math because of how they teach it; learning math correctly will not be the same experience as from learning in public schools.</p>
		      <h3>Other Notes</h3>
		      <p>There are other places to get books that I don't recommend, like this one; however I mostly get my books through amazon, I will link each book at a later date.</p>
		      <p>On getting help: Use math.stackexange, psychicsforum, and maybe /r/math or /r/learnmath if you need assistance. Remember to be polite, these people aren't getting paid to teach you, they do it out of their love for math and for helping others.</p>
		    <h2>The Guide</h2>
		      <h3>Lower Maths</h3>
		      <p> I consider Lower Maths as something every human being should know before they die.</p>
		      <p>In this guide Lower Maths is defined as anything bellow Calculus. Many people are beyond this level and many people are not, if you feel like you need a better basis of knowledge then follow this.</p>
		      <p>Honestly the only thing many people will need is Khan Academy. It is essential that you do the exercizes on the website, in math practice is essential to understanding. Up to the calculus level Khan Academy is all you will probably need and for higher maths use Khan Academy as a complimentary resource, but don't solely rely on it. </p>
		      <h3>Calculus</h3>
		      <p>Calculus isn't something everyone should know, but a person's education can't be called fulfilling without grasping the concept of calculus. A person cannot be considered educated unless they know calculus in my opinion.</p>
		      <p>Read Stewart's book, do one to two chapters three times a week (or daily if you are an over achiever) and on at least one day a week review what you have learned. Skip the focus on problem solving until you have finished the entire thing. If you need any assistance go on Khan Academy or PatrickJMT for complimentary resources.</p>
		      <p>Read a Short Intro to Proofs book, I recommend Velleman's How to Prove It: A Structured Approach and Rotman's Journey Into Mathemathics: An Introduction to Proofs.</p>
		      <p>Get Spivak's calculus and finish the entire thing.</p>
		      <h3>Higher Maths</h3>
		      <p>Higher Maths are everything beyond Calculus, mastering these allows you to call yourself a Mathematician, and while not every "educated" person need to know these, if you wish to reach Uberman status you should.</p>
		      <p>Finish a book on Multivariable and Vector Calculus (I don't have any specific books in mind, please email or commit if you have any ideas). Take Strang's book on Linear Algebra in order to get a good grasp on differental equations from somewhere else. Read either Courant or Apostol, I recommend Apostol, but it's up to the individual, in order to get a more rigrous calculus review and also to keep up on your proofs. If you want a challenge go onto Abstract Algebra (recommend or commit a book). If you want to continue Linear Algebra read Lay's book before you start on Rudin.</p>
		      <p>Start Baby Rudin, if you have followed the guide so far and understood everything then it should be a breeze. If you haven't done Abstract Algebra yet, now is the time.</p>
		      <p>Start Papa Rudin</p>
		    <h2>To-Do</h2>
		      <p>Some subjects and areas need book recommendations. If you have any ideas either email me at cognitios@teknik.io or commit them.</p>
		      <p>Topology and Algebra all need to be expanded upon a bit more.</p>
		      <p>Geometry, Combinatorics, Set Theory, Logic, and Number Theory all need to be included.</p>

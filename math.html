				<h2>Introduction</h2>
		      <h3>Why Should I learn Math?</h3>
		      </p>I won't lie, if you don't want to learn math then you shouldn't. Knowing how to use math makes life a lot easier and you can solve problems a lot easier. Knowing math takes a bit of practice and public schools have made many people turned off to math because of how they teach it; learning math correctly will not be the same experience as from learning in public schools.</p>
		    <h2>The Guide</h2>
		      <h3>Lower Maths</h3>
		      <p>In this guide Lower Maths is defined as anything bellow Calculus. Many people are beyond this level and many people are not, if you feel like you need a better basis of knowledge then follow this.</p>
		      <p>Honestly the only thing many people will need is Khan Academy. It is essential that you do the exercizes on the website, in math practice is essential to understanding. Up to the calculus level Khan Academy is all you will probably need and for higher maths use Khan Academy as a complimentary resource, but don't solely rely on it. </p>

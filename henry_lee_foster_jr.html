		<p>1926 - </p>
		<hr>
		<p>Henry "Hank" Lee "HL" Foster Jr. was born January 1st, 1926 in Taylor County, Texas to Henry Lee Foster Sr. and Lela Mae Richardson [1]. 
		Henry Lee Foster Jr was called HL as a child, his original birth certificate actually listed his name as HL, he had it changed when
		joining the navy as they wouldn't accept HL as a name. On both sides of his family going by the first two initials was a traditional
		naming scheme, everyone knew him as HL. As a child HL would move around centeral Texas quite often, some of the places he lived as a 
		boy included Lamesa, Odessa, Lubbock, and Hamby. Hamby was home to his maternal family and Elmdale, a small community a few miles 
		away was home to his paternal family.</p>

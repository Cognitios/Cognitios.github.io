		score ever given by the University. He averaged 100% in touch typing, 92.5% in radio code, 100% in radio procedure, and
		95.8% in radio theory, averaging 97.1% for his 850 hours of class work. Physically he was rated first in his company and second in his
		regiment, he was six foot one and weighed 210 lbs.</p>

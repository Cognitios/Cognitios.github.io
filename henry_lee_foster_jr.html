		<p>1926 - </p>
		<hr>
		<p>Henry "Hank" Lee "HL" Foster Jr. was born January 1st, 1926 in Taylor County, Texas to Henry Lee Foster Sr. and Lela Mae Richardson [1]. 
		Henry Lee Foster Jr was called HL as a child, his original birth certificate actually listed his name as HL, he had it changed when
		joining the navy as they wouldn't accept HL as a name. On both sides of his family going by the first two initials was a traditional
		naming scheme, everyone knew him as HL. HL's father worked a variety of odd jobs, mostly in oil field work, construction, and general labor
		and as a child HL moved around central Texas quite often. Some of the places he lived as a boy included Lamesa, Odessa, Lubbock, and Hamby.
		Hamby was home to his maternal family and Elmdale, a small community a few miles away was home to his paternal family.</p>

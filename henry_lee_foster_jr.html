		<center><h3>Henry "Hank" Lee "HL" Foster Jr.</h3>
		<p>1926 - </p>
		<hr>
		<p>Henry "Hank" Lee "HL" Foster Jr. was born January 1st, 1926 in Taylor County, Texas to Henry Lee Foster Sr. and Lela Mae Richardson [1]. 
		Henry Lee Foster Jr was called HL as a child, his original birth certificate actually listed his name as HL, he had it changed when
		joining the navy as they wouldn't accept HL as a name. On both sides of his family going by the first two initials was a traditional
		naming scheme, everyone knew him as HL. As a child HL would move around centeral Texas quite often, some of the places he lived as a 
		boy included Lamesa, Odessa, Lubbock, and Hamby. Hamby was home to his maternal family and Elmdale, a small community a few miles 
		away was home to his paternal family.</p>

		<h6>HL's Birth Certificate, original on the right</h6>
		<p>As a young boy HL was close with both sides of his family, he has kept in contact with all his relatives even
		to current day. He had a special relationship with his uncle, TC Richardson Jr, who was close in age to him and
		also his best friend. TC and HL were inseperable, they both enlisted during WWII and managed to meet up in japan.
		To HL TC held many roles including a brother and a paternal figure in his life, the two would remain close for their entire lives.</p>

		<p>HL first attended grammar school in Hamby, his family's farm was adjacent from the school yard and was across the road

		<p>His family moved to Los Angeles, California shortly after his graduation from high school where he continued 
		his efforts for admittance to the USN Pilot Training Program(V5) but could not pass the physical exam because of high blood pressure.  
		Failing this, he was inducted into the USN on April 29th, 1944. After he graduated he attended basic and went to the 
		University of Idaho to attend their radio school program. At Radio School he was given high praise, he was claimed to be 
		"One of the best students in the history of this school" in one report given to his parents. He recieved a perfect score 
		in radio procedure which at the time was the only perfect score ever given by the University. He averaged 100% in touch typing, 
		92.5% in radio code, 100% in radio procedure, and 95.8% in radio theory, averaging 97.1% for his 850 hours of class work.

		<h6>HL after graduating from Radio School</h6>
		<p>After graduating Radio School HL was allowed home for a while before leaving for Bremerton Washington, where
		he was recieved by LST 334 on January 26th of 1945. At the time he was ranked a Seaman First Class with a Radioman
		rating. He would stay on the LST until April 2nd where he would land on the Japenese Island of Okinawa. A day before
		they landed on Okinawwa HL was promoted from Seasman first class to Radioman Third Class. On April 2nd LST 334 landed
		on Okinawa where HL participated in the battle. On May 17th 1945 HL was transfered to LST 476 where he would be assigned
		to occupation duty in the far east. On November 1st 1945 HL would be promoted to Radioman Second Class, his final promotion
		in his naval service. He would stay on LST 476 until Feburary 12, 1945 where the ship would become decommissioned. For four days
		in temporary he worked on LST 672 before transfering once again to LST 911 on Feburary 16, 1945. He would stay on LST 911
		for the remainder of active sea duty in the navy until June 12, 1946 where he was transfered to San Pedro, California only
		10 days before the ships decomission. HL was discharged from the Navy on June 19th, 1946 at the USN Recieving Station on Terminal

		the US he was frozen to it's crew until he had reached the US.</p>

		<i> "I have a large water damaged picture of me and others on the quarter-deck as we passed under the Golden Gate Bridge 
		into San Francisco Bay upon our return to the US.  It's difficult to explain how we felt on that day as just a few months 
		earlier most of us expected  that the Allies would be required to invade the Japanese Homeland  to achieve surrender.   
		This would have had horrible consequences and there was no way that the surrender would have occurred until total defeat without the Atomic bombing.  
		It's striking to hear those who maintain that the bombs were unnecessary because the Japanese were already defeated.  
		Those voices were from demagogues who hadn't the faintest idea of the Japanese mentality at that time as we did who had been in the struggle for so long.  
		It was a brave and intelligent decision that our recently appointed President made which probably saved millions of lives and untold suffering.

		Once back home I, like millions of other returned and returning GIs, set our sights on getting on with our lives.  
		Fortunately, we had National leadership at that time that was dedicated to dealing with the profound issues that it faced both at home and abroad.  
		With the abrupt change in direction of most of our industrial capacity and the hordes of returning GIs, what could have been catastrophic 
		resulted in launching the groundwork for the greatest period of growth of any nation in world history as well as to save the World from a 
		perpetuation of World War II by the Soviet Union."</i><p>- Henry Lee Foster Jr. on his return from the war</p>
		<h6>The LST's in chronological order, from left to right that HL served on.</h6>
		<p>HL's mother and sister were present for the discharging ceremonies, this was the first time he had seen
		them since his parents and sister took him to Los Angles on the day of his induction. He would live with
		his family in a housing project near San Pedro called Banning Homes. His mother and sister both had jobs
		working at shipyards, however they did not have a car and relied on busses and the LA Railway Express Systems
		(also known as the famous red cars). After discharge from the US Navy, he continued his formal education 
		first at Compton College in California and then at Texas A&M where he received a BSEE in 1952.  While in attendance 
		there he was admitted to the Tau-Beta-Pi honorary engineering society.  He continued to work with Navy electronics 
		as a civilian employee for a number of years before joining industry.  He continued with his formal education with 
		numerous courses in Mathematics and Engineering through extension studies provided by UCLA.  He retired in  1987.</p>

		<center><h3>Paula Allison</h3>
		<p>1933 - 1980</p>
		<hr>
		<p>Paula Allison Rohles was born on September 13, 1933 in Richmond, California [1]. She was the daughter of Ethel Mahany
    and Barney Rohles. As a young girl Paula lived in Contra Costa County, her parents managed and operated many resteraunts,
    dining rooms, and even hotdog stands in the area surrounding Richmond. When Paula was four years old her parents bought
    the only house that they would ever own, 6000 Plumas Ave, in Richmond. Paula's maternal grandmother, the only grandparent
    she would know, Annie Jane Brown would live with them until her death in 1944. In 1939 the house would be rented out and
    the family was moved to Walnut Creek temporarily for the operation of a leased bus stop resteraunt and a gas station. 
    Unfortunately a year later her parents would go broke which required them to move back to the Richmond house. When Paula was 
    14 her father passed away at the age of 69</p>

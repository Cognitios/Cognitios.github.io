		<center><h3>Paula Allison Rohles</h3>
		<p>1933 - 1980</p>
		<hr>
		<p>Paula Allison Rohles was born on September 13, 1933 in Richmond, California [1]. She was the daughter of Ethel Mahany
  		and Barney Rohles. As a young girl Paula lived in Contra Costa County, her parents managed and operated many resteraunts,
  		dining rooms, and even hotdog stands in the area surrounding Richmond. When Paula was four years old her parents bought
  		the only house that they would ever own, 6000 Plumas Ave, in Richmond. Paula's maternal grandmother, the only grandparent
  		she would know, Annie Jane Brown would live with them until her death in 1944. In 1939 the house would be rented out and
  		the family was moved to Walnut Creek temporarily for the operation of a leased bus stop resteraunt and a gas station. 
 		Unfortunately a year later her parents would go broke which required them to move back to the Richmond house. When Paula was 
 		14 her father passed away at the age of 69.</p>

		<p>In high school Paula played the cello and by all accounts she was a very talented cellist. Her first three years of 
		high school were spent at El Cerrito High in Contra Costa County. Her siblings all also attended El Cerrito, the other 
		three graduated but Paula spent a year in Washington DC living with her Aunt Esther, her mother's twin sister. In Washington
		she did well academically and was a member of the yearbook staff along with the Orchestra. She was known for saying "for corns
		sake" in high school and everyone knew not only her name, but also the name of her cello, Luke. </p>
